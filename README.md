My solutions for Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/>

Sometimes, the goal of these solutions is to find the answer of the puzzles as quickly as possible (in real time, not in computation time). This explains the use of python, the inefficient algorithms, the non-descriptive variable names and other oddities.

Sometimes, I use these problems to learn or test a language.
